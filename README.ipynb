    "Our cities are more crowded than ever. The 20th century was marked worldwide by migration of populations to cities and this trend shows no signals of slowing down.

However it has lent its self to prioritizing personal vehical transportation over other, more effiecnt ones. Namely the bicycle. When focusing on intra city journys, bicycles are arguably use limited transportation space most efficently.\n",
